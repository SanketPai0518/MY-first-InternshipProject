My first Internship project!!! I was tasked with creating a model that can be used to identify around 10 different bollywood actors using Artificial Neural Networks.
I was able to accomplish this task using two different models, The MLPClassifier offered by sklearn and by creating my own multi perceptron layers using Tensorflow.
This project really helped me expand my knowledge in terms of image classification and data preprocessing.
